Version 0.001
=============

Initial release.

Version 0.002
=============

Significant changes to the interface.  The new interface is more
general, and should allow different readers to be addressed with
roughly the same interface, much like accessing different databases
with DBI drivers.  An attempt at backwards compatibility has been
made, but it's half-hearted at best.  See the perldoc for details.
Now built on top of general classes from RFID::Base and RFID::EPC.

Support for continuous reading mode has been removed, at least
temporarily.  I found it unreliable, and there isn't a way to fit it
into the new driver model yet.  The code is still there if anybody
wants to try turning it back on.
